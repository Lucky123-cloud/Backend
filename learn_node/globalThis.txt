global this is a global variable - points to the window object

then why do we need it? if it is the same as window

Well, globalThis can be used outside the browser

Node does not really work as a browser. The node version of window is Global object


globalThis and global exist as both part of window and node

for us to use the import export from ES6 we have to either use .mjs extension, or
we add "type": "module",  in our package.json, if you dont have package.json, just
run npm init -y
