Here's an interesting fact about **Napoleon Bonaparte**:

Despite being known as one of history’s greatest military leaders,
**Napoleon was once attacked by a horde of bunnies**. 
He had organized a rabbit hunt for himself and his men,
and his chief of staff gathered hundreds of rabbits for the event.
But instead of fleeing when released, the rabbits swarmed Napoleon and his party—because they were tame and thought they were being fed. It turned into a comical chaos, with Napoleon reportedly fleeing the field to escape the fluffy ambush.

History has its odd moments!
