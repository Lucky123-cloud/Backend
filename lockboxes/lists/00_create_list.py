# Lists are one of Python's most versatile and commonly used data structures. They are ordered, mutable collections that can hold a variety of object types.

# empty lists
epmty_list = []

# list with elements
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits = ['aaple', 'banana', 'cherry']
mixed = [1, 'hello', 3.14, True]
